# Frontend Mentor challenge - Social proof section

<p>My version of Social proof section for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used plain HTML and SASS. Component is responsive! This one was quite fun to create.</p>
